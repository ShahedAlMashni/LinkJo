Problem: 
Currently in Jordan, there is no place to refer to when someone wants to meet new people or spend their weekend a bit differently. Events, conferences, competitions are posted on Facebook groups or spread in words of mouth which makes it hard to search for new things or keep track of what’s happening around you. Also, Facebook is not an ideal place to look for things for people who don't spend their time on social media.

I want to create this platform to make a space for everyone to search for things efficiently and expand their network.

Solution: 
Link JO is an all in one platform that provides unique experience to anyone who wants to engage in a community of their interests. 

Some Features:
The platform contains information on events that happen in Jordan throughout the year in various fields of health, technology, environment, or entrepreneurship.
The platform also includes a Call For Volunteer section where students/professionals can apply to volunteer in any field of their choice. 
To add a more personalized experience, users have a profile where they can share their bios and add badges on the events they have attended. 
Forum is added to discuss and engage with users on the platform.

Why volunteering and events?
It’s very easy to get sunked up in the routine of school or work and not have time to explore different things. 
It’s through events that people expand their network, gain new insights and potentially improve their careers. 
Volunteering is also a perfect way to make friends and increase your social relationships while also improving different soft and technical skills.
Finally, a lot of schools and universities require a certain number of volunteering hours that students should finish to gain their degree, but students usually struggle to find an organization or a place to do their volunteering hours.
